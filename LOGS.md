## About FINDMEJOB

I built this project for the sole purpose of satisfying the requirements of the assignment given by Torre talent team for the `Software Developer Intern ` position at Torre. 

### How the journey went

*   It was around 12 am on Saturday my local time that I received the test via email as agreed with `Maria`, I read the description of the assignment and started thinking about what to implement.

*  I started testing the APIs given to see the output and how I can use it.

*  I have finally decided that I will build an application that will work as self job finder
